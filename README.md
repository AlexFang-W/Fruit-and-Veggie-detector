# Fruit & Vegetable Classifier
This repository contains an AI model designed to identify different fruits and vegetables from images. The model uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify various produce types with high accuracy. It is intended for applications such as grocery automation, dietary tracking, educational tools, and AI-powered kitchen assistants.
## The Algorithm
This AI model was trained on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano using a connected camera to capture fruit and vegetable images in real time. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for image classification, trained with augmented data (rotation, scaling, brightness adjustments) to improve accuracy in diverse conditions.
The training was performed directly on the Jetson Nano using PyTorch with GPU acceleration, and the final model runs in real time, processing live camera input and outputting the predicted produce type with confidence scores.
